MESSAGE FOR LOCAL INSTALLS: Please make sure to run BatchQuest.bat when you want to play the game. That is how it is meant to be played. 
And as always, have fun!

## please read the following wiki

### -DISCLAIMER-
BatchQuest needs to modify files to function correctly. Sometimes, anti virus's will flag this as suspicious. This is a false flag, and BatchQuest is not actually doing anything harmful to your computer. To play it properly, please add the folder it lives in as an exception.

Batch Quest will never create, modify, or delete any files outside of its folder.


This project is no longer under Project SOLIAS. It is now a solo project I will work on myself. Please bear with me on the speed of the story production because of this.  -  BatchQuest is currently early in development. Please do not expect any features to stay, or anything to be complete.


# BatchQuest
A series of Batch Files that make a story game.

*Will you delve deep into the depths of Arcallis and find the hidden truths within?*
